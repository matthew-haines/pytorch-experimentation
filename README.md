# pytorch-experimentation
A collection of various programs and machine learning models that I made using PyTorch.

### Framework
A small modular framework that allows you to create neural networks in a similar fashion to keras. Differentiated by hand.

### Vanilla NN
An initial test of PyTorch's GPU capabilities, approximates the sin function. Differentiated by hand.

### Pytorch NN
An initial test of PyTorch's autograd capabilities.

### Batch Learning
A combination of PyTorch's autograd capabilities and a batch_learning system.
